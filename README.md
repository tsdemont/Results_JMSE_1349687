This repository contains the data files for the results of "Sliding Mode Control of a Nonlinear Wave Energy Converter Model". 
The objective of the files is to allow researchers to verify their results with the controller proposed in: 
T Demonte Gonzalez, GG Parker, E Anderlini, WW Weaver, "Sliding Mode Control of a Nonlinear Wave Energy Converter Model", Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, 2021. 

The files are in .mat format. 

Each file is named with the figure number from the above mentioned paper and a short description of the data on each file.

The files contain time series data where column 1 is Time (s).

The columns of the time series contained in Figure7_EnergyAbsorbed represent the energy absorbed in Joules at each wave period. Column 1 of the Data is for wave period T=3 (s), Column 2 for T=4 (s), and so on up to T=9 (s).

Sphere_5m_WAMIT_data contains the data obtained from WAMIT for a Sphere of 5 (m) in diameter.
